# Farmer_Job_Application
Spring is also knocking on the door of the "Drink My Friend" vineyard. As we all know, grapes love care and work, but most of all they love labour, which is usually rewarded with a good harvest. The vineyard needs a lot of helpers, so an application is being prepared for those who want to apply for a job.

Applications are invited from those who can work during the weeks of the spring season. When applying, they should give their name and which days of the week they can go to work. The days are given as follows: Monday Wednesday Thursday. Candidates will separate the days with a space. The farm knows how many workers it needs on which days (Mondays, Tuesdays, etc.). If a day is already full, the application should not accept applicants for that day.

The data of the applicants will be stored in a file, and in addition to the data entry, we should have the possibility to modify, delete and create a list of applicants by area or a complete list of applicants.
